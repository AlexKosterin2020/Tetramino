# Tetramino
Hello! This is code of Tetramino. I create this project on WPF without any game engine. It was a strange decision, but I wanted focus on my code and I've learnt a lot of things that are needed in the job

Navigation:  
MainWindow.xaml - display on screen  
MainWindow.xaml.cs - user interaction with the interface  
GameState.cs - managing the current state of the game  
GameGrid.cs - modelling of the playing field  
BlockQueue.cs - block queue management  
Block.cs - block movement  
Position.cs - stores information about the position on the playing field  
Settings.cs - stores records, number of boosters, states and language  
MosaicChoice.cs - stores the order of image generation in Mosaic mode
